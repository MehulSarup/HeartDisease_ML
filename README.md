## What is heart disease?
Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's also called cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in many countries. 

## Aim:
To analyze of the factors that influence heart disease. Then trying to predict heart disease based on significant factors beforehand so that patients can be warned

## Motivation:
If it's possible to predict that a patient has heart disease based on the factors which are similar to those people who have been diagnosed with heart disease then it would save many lives. The patient can then be warned beforehand to take precautionary measures which would save time. Using Machine Learning to predict if a patient has a chance of being diagnosed with heart disease would help the doctors save the number of tests and then focus on critical tests.

## Results:
A KNN Classifer model has been trained to predict heart disease in a patient with an accuracy of 99%
